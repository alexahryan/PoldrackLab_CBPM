# PoldrackLab_CBPM
This code is intended to perform connectome-based predictive modeling on a dataset of fMRI scans collected while participants performed 8 tasks: the stop signal task (Logan & Cowan, 1984), the conditional motor selective stop-signal task (De Jong, Coles, & Logan, 1995), the Stroop task (Stroop, 1935), the Dot Pattern Expectancy task (DPX; Jones et al. 2010), the Attention Network Task (ANT; Fan et al. 2002), the Columbia Card Task (hot version) (CCTHot; Figner et al. 2009), cued task switching (Meiran 1996), the Kirby Delay Discounting task (Kirby & MarakoviÄ‡, 1996), the Delay Discounting Titration, and the Tower of Hanoi. 
To perform this analysis, first functional connectivity must be performed on preprocessed scans. 
The functional connectivity in this repository uses Smorgasbord parcellation. 
Next, the functional connectivity matrices can be inputted to the code for connectome-based predictive modeling.
